### content of two files 
* file 1 "classifier" contains:
    * finding the best choice of **K** using cross-validation tool
    * build a model with the best **K** 
    * showing the result of the model on test data
    * choose randomly a item from data and applied the model on it
    
* file 2 "drawingImage" contains :
    * import the file classifier as module 
    * drawing an image of a pseudo number using mouse click event 
    * resize/ flatten the image, to be in the same shape of training data and plot it
    * predict the value (the prediction is not good because resizing image not good, i ll try to get it better soon)
